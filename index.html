                        <p>When we talk about the justification of a project, we're not discussing it in isolation. Rather, we're situating it within the larger strategic vision of the organisation. Every well-founded project exists for a reason‚Äînamely, to advance one or more organisational goals. This alignment is what gives a project its legitimacy.</p>

                        <p>Consider this: if a company's strategic aim is to grow its market presence, then a project designed to launch a new product line becomes not only relevant, but necessary. Its outcomes are no longer just internal deliverables‚Äîthey become stepping stones toward strategic success. In short, the justification for the project lies in how well it supports the broader objectives of the business.</p>

                        <p>Every project should connect to the bigger picture‚Äîthat is, to at least one of the organisation's strategic goals. Even if a project is small or highly focused, it shouldn't be disconnected from the broader mission. This connection ensures the project adds value beyond its immediate outputs.</p>

                        <p>Take this example: if improving customer satisfaction is a key strategic goal, then launching a project to upgrade the customer support system makes perfect sense. Objectives like speeding up response times or boosting issue resolution rates clearly support that wider aim. When project goals are linked like this, the work becomes part of a purposeful strategy‚Äînot just a standalone task.</p>
